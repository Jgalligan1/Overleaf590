I'm Jack Galligan, a software engineering major who has spent 8 years pursuing software development.  My preference is Python although I've done a little bit of a lot of the major languages, and I have a dog named Luna.

My name is Collin Smith, and I'm a 4/4 computer science major. I am most experienced in Java and Python, but I have learned and used about a dozen different programming and scripting languages. I am the youngest of three brothers in my family, and we have a dog named Zoey.

My name is James Grant and I am a senior Software Engineering major. I’ve been programming for about 4 years now and my favorite coding languages are Python and Javascript. I’ve
been a member of several organizations on campus including SUMAC and the Software Engineering Club, as well as a member of Chi Phi Fraternity for 3 years. In my free time, I like to watch
movies, go to the gym, and play video games.
